How to use & What it does:

You use the program by adding or deleting posts, and then viewing them on the home page. You
can also click on a specific post for more details.

Issues I ran into:

The only issue I ran into was trying to open the raw html files with a browser. Since I'm using module
imports and query parameters the site needs to be hosted.

The site is hosted here:
https://jsadowyj0.github.io/CIS212_Homework02_JacobSadowyj/

If you would like to host it yourself just navigate to the project directory in terminal and type:
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080

This will listen to port 8080 on all interfaces.
